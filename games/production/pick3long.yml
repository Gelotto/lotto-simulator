# the number of numbers in a ticket:
n: 3

# the smallest and largest possible values for numbers:
min: 0
max: 46

# price of a ticket:
price: 5

# minimum balance to keep in the pot at all times, which is back-filled by the
# house when it drops below 0:
min_pot: 50000

# the number of additional tickets needed to step up payout amounts (by the
# amounts defined in `payout_step_sizes`):
step_up_ticket_count: 10000000000

# payout_step_sizes associates possible match counts that a winning ticket can
# have with an "payout step-up" amount. Each time that the number of tickets
# increases by the amount defined by step_up_ticket_count above, the payout
# amount for this match count increases by this amount.
#
# For example, the 3: 300 entry means that a ticket that matches 3 of 5 numbers
# with the winning numbers receives 300 minimum. If the ticket count increases
# by a sufficient amount, however, it becomes 600.
payout_step_sizes:
 


# similar to payout_step_sizes; however, the right-hand side in
# `payout_pot_percents` represents a percentage of the pot that should be paid
# out. For example, "5: 0.8" means that a ticket with 3 of 5 matching numbers
# shall receive 80% of the pot size. If this or payout_step_sizes causes the
# balance of the lotto go negative, the house pays the difference and backfills
# the lotto until it's balance is the value defined by `min_pot`.
payout_pot_percents:
  3: 0.80

# wallets that buy tickets each round:
min_users: 10
max_users: 100

# lower and upper bounds for the randomness that determines the number of
# tickets each user buys in each round:
min_tickets_per_user: 1
max_tickets_per_user: 250

# if true, then anything left in the lotto's balance, minus the min pot size,
# will be transfered to the house at the end of each round.
